# Unified Setup Summary - Version 2.0

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

The Kubernetes Assessment Framework has been **completely reorganized and unified** into a clean, production-ready system.

### Key Improvements

1. **✅ Single-Command Setup**
   - One script (`deploy-complete-setup.sh`) does everything
   - No more running 5 different scripts sequentially
   - Automated API key generation
   - Complete infrastructure deployment in 5 minutes

2. **✅ Unified CloudFormation Template**
   - Integrated professor's cleaner template structure
   - Added Kyverno installation in UserData
   - Embedded remote evaluation capabilities
   - Uses AWS::LanguageExtensions for better organization
   - Proper VPC/subnet/security group setup

3. **✅ Cleaner Repository Structure**
   - Old scripts moved to `legacy-scripts/`
   - Only essential files in main directories
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to navigate and understand

4. **✅ Simplified Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with clear quick start
   - Step-by-step instructions for both instructors and students
   - Troubleshooting guide based on real issues
   - Examples and use cases

## 🚀 How to Use (Instructors)

### Setup (One Command!)

```bash
cd instructor-tools
./deploy-complete-setup.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Creates S3 buckets (results + templates)
2. Deploys Lambda functions (evaluation + submission)
3. Generates API key
4. Configures CloudFormation template with endpoints
5. Uploads template to public S3
6. Creates beautiful student landing page
7. Displays all URLs and credentials

**Output you'll get:**
```
Student Landing Page: https://k8s-assessment-templates.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
Evaluation Endpoint: https://xxxxx.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/
Submission Endpoint: https://yyyyy.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/
API Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### View Results

```bash
cd instructor-tools
./view-results.sh
```

Interactive menu to:
- View all submissions
- Filter by Neptun Code
- Filter by Task
- Download results
- Generate summary report

---

## 🎓 How to Use (Students)

### Deployment (One Click!)

1. Visit landing page URL (from instructor)
2. Click "Deploy My Environment"
3. Enter Neptun Code (6 chars)
4. Select task
5. Click "Create Stack"
6. Wait 5-10 minutes
7. SSH in and start working!

### Workflow

```bash
# SSH into your environment
ssh -i ~/Downloads/labsuser.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC-IP>

# Read welcome message
cat ~/welcome.txt

# Navigate to task
cd ~/k8s-workspace/tasks/task-01
cat README.md

# Create solution
nano solution.yaml
kubectl apply -f solution.yaml

# Evaluate (can run multiple times)
~/student-tools/request-evaluation.sh task-01

# Submit when satisfied
~/student-tools/submit-final.sh task-01
```

- **Communication**: Service account token + API key authentication

### Security
- ✅ API key authentication on all endpoints
- ✅ Students cannot access evaluation logic
- ✅ Isolated environments per student
- ✅ Private results bucket (instructor-only)
- ✅ Public template bucket (read-only for students)

### Automation
- ✅ Kyverno installed automatically
- ✅ Service account created automatically
- ✅ Evaluation scripts embedded in instance
- ✅ Auto-shutdown after 4 hours
- ✅ Complete workspace setup

**Adopted from Professor's Template:**
- `AWS::LanguageExtensions` transform
- Proper parameter grouping with labels
- Complete VPC setup (VPC, IGW, Subnet, RouteTable)
- Security group with all required ports

- vockey key pair (standard in Learner Lab)

**Added for Remote Evaluation:**
- Kyverno installation in UserData
- Service account token creation
- Cluster info export for evaluation
- Evaluation/submission scripts with API key

- Welcome message generation
- Auto-shutdown configuration

### Lambda Functions

**Evaluation Lambda:**
- Receives cluster credentials from student
- Connects to student K8s API remotely
- Evaluates task completion
- Returns detailed scoring
- Stores results in S3

**Submission Lambda:**
- Validates student submissions
- Stores final results in S3
- Links to evaluation results
- Provides confirmation

**Authentication:**
- API key in X-API-Key header

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Testing (Recommended)

1. **Test instructor setup:**
   ```bash
   cd instructor-tools
   ./deploy-complete-setup.sh
   ```

2. **Verify endpoints:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST $(cat EVALUATION_ENDPOINT.txt) \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-API-Key: $(cat API_KEY.txt)" \
     -d '{"test": true}'
   ```

3. **Test student deployment:**
   - Open CloudFormation quick-deploy link
   - Deploy with test Neptun Code: `TEST01`
   - SSH into instance
   - Run evaluation workflow

4. **Verify results:**
   ```bash
   cd instructor-tools
   ./view-results.sh
   ```

### Production Deployment

Once testing is complete:
1. Share landing page URL with students
2. Monitor submissions via `view-results.sh`
3. Download results after deadline
4. Cleanup student stacks when done

## 💡 Tips and Best Practices

### For Instructors

- **Keep API_KEY.txt safe** - Required for all operations
- **Save endpoint files** - EVALUATION_ENDPOINT.txt and SUBMISSION_ENDPOINT.txt
- **Test before class** - Deploy one complete student environment first
- **Monitor costs** - Each student environment costs ~$0.17 for 4 hours
- **Download results regularly** - Use `view-results.sh` option 5

### For Students

- **Start early** - Environment setup takes 5-10 minutes
- **Save work** - Environment auto-deletes after 4 hours
- **Test frequently** - Evaluation can be run multiple times
- **Read welcome.txt** - Contains all instructions
- **Submit when confident** - Final submission is permanent

## 🐛 Known Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Could not set public bucket policy"
**Solution**: This is expected in AWS Learner Lab. The script handles it automatically by disabling bucket-level Block Public Access.

### Issue: "Lambda deployment takes long time"
**Solution**: Normal - packaging Python code and uploading to Lambda takes 1-2 minutes.

### Issue: "Template parameter constraint violation"
**Solution**: Re-run deploy-complete-setup.sh to re-upload template with correct defaults.

2. **Serverless evaluation** - Lambda functions for remote assessment
3. **Infrastructure as Code** - CloudFormation for reproducible environments
4. **Policy-driven validation** - Kyverno for Kubernetes policy enforcement
5. **API design** - RESTful Lambda function URLs with authentication
6. **Cost optimization** - Pay-per-use, auto-cleanup
7. **Security best practices** - Isolated environments, API keys, least privilege
