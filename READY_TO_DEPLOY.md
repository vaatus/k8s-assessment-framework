## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd instructor-tools
./deploy-complete-setup.sh
```

This will:
1. Create S3 buckets (results + templates)
2. Deploy Lambda functions (evaluation + submission)
3. Generate API key
4. Configure CloudFormation template
5. Upload template to S3
6. Create student landing page
7. Display all URLs and credentials

**Expected time**: 3-5 minutes

### Step 2: Test Deployment

```bash
./test-complete-deployment.sh
```

This will:
1. Check prerequisites (AWS CLI, credentials)
2. Verify S3 buckets
3. Verify Lambda functions
4. Check endpoint files
5. Validate CloudFormation template
6. Test Lambda endpoints
7. Check IAM configuration

**Expected result**: All tests should pass ✅

### Step 3: Share with Students

You'll get a landing page URL like:
```
https://k8s-assessment-templates.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
```

**Share this URL with your students** - they can deploy with one click!

## 🧪 Testing Workflow

### Test 1: Instructor Setup
```bash
cd instructor-tools
./deploy-complete-setup.sh
```
- Confirm: yes
- Wait 3-5 minutes
- Check output for URLs and credentials

### Test 2: Verify Infrastructure
```bash
./test-complete-deployment.sh
```
- Should show all green ✅
- All tests should pass
- No red ❌ errors

### Test 3: Student Deployment (Optional)
1. Open landing page URL in browser
2. Click "Deploy My Environment"
3. Enter test Neptun Code: `TEST01`
4. Select `task-01`
5. Click "Create Stack"
6. Wait 5-10 minutes
7. Check "Outputs" tab for SSH details

### Test 4: Student Workflow (Optional)
```bash
# SSH into student instance
ssh -i labsuser.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC-IP>

# Check welcome message
cat ~/welcome.txt

# Navigate to task
cd ~/k8s-workspace/tasks/task-01

# Check K3s
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A

# Check Kyverno
kubectl get pods -n kyverno

# Test evaluation
~/student-tools/request-evaluation.sh task-01
```

### Test 5: View Results
```bash
cd instructor-tools
./view-results.sh
```
- Select option to view latest evaluations
- Check if test evaluation appears

## 🔑 Generated Credentials

After running `deploy-complete-setup.sh`, you'll have:

### Files Created
- `EVALUATION_ENDPOINT.txt` - Evaluation Lambda URL
- `SUBMISSION_ENDPOINT.txt` - Submission Lambda URL
- `API_KEY.txt` - API key (chmod 600)

### Example Values
```bash
EVALUATION_ENDPOINT: https://xxxxx.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/
SUBMISSION_ENDPOINT: https://yyyyy.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/
API_KEY: 32-character hexadecimal string
```

**Important**: Keep API_KEY.txt secure!

- ✅ Public templates bucket (read-only for students)
- ✅ Service account tokens for remote K8s access
- ✅ Security groups with only required ports
- ✅ LabRole permissions (AWS Learner Lab compatible)
